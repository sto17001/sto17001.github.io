            <h3>Founders Day Fresco</h3>
            <p>By Ryan Smith</p>
            <p>This founder's day parade was amazing. Things went according to plan. Everyone was as happy as could be.
                There was corndogs, cotton candy, popcorn,
                and much more. If you missed out on the fun, there will be another parade coming up on the 1st of next
                month. The highlight of the day was the marching band!
                Eventhough it was snowing they still played their hearts out and marched through the 5 feet of snow that
                was covering the road. Most of the event was enclosed
                to keep everyone warm, but the marching band was spectacular out in the snow. The mayor of the town said
                that it was the most courageous thing he has ever seen
                in his entire life. That is saying something, considering our mayor has served in the army. Alright
                that's my article.
