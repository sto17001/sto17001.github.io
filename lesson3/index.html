        <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
        <p>Here at "When will there be Good Weather?" we are dedicated at providing the best updates and
            forecasts possilbe to help guide you in making decisions. We would all like to make sure that 
            if we are planning on going swimming that it is sunny outside. Or if we are planning on going 
            skiing, we want to make sure that it is snowing or it has snowed in the past couple of days. 
            That is our purpose, to make sure you have a reliable source to base your decisions off of for
            your weather related activities.
