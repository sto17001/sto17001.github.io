                he wears the right clothes to work so he can stay healthy and strong for his family. In the past
                when he wouldn't check the weather he would wear a long sleeve when he needed a jacket. The result,
                he would come home sick and wouldn't be able to spend as much time with his family. Ricky needs to 
                know the weather everyday for his job, his family, and his well-being.
