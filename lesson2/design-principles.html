        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

        <p>The Google Venture portfolio section of their website demonstrates a very clean example
            of the rule of thirds. By breaking up the page in three different sections it helps attract
            the viewers attention. They also put the most importatnt information in the top left grid,
            where the viewer is most likely to look.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <img src="lesson2/nordstrom.JPG" alt="snippet of nordstrom's website">
        <p>On Nordstrom's website they have used the alignment property perfectly all throughout.
            They group many similar items together, helping our brains group them together and making
            it more appealing. The use of the alignment is clean and helps keep things grouped together.

        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>Walmart</p>
        <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">walmart.com</a>
        <br>
        <img src="lesson2/walmart.JPG" alt="snippet of walmart's website showing repetition">
        <p>Walmart has a great repetition of their colors and block formatting on their website. The 
            repetition helps keep things familiar but it isn't annoying about it. It helps guide the viewer
            in a clear way as well as organize infomration coherently. Overall, I think walmart does a good
            job at using repetition within their website.
